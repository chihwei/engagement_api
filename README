Requirments
-----------
Flash Builder 4 or better, must use AS3.

Files Provided
--------------
- SVSWC.swc
This file wills setup code hinting and load the SocialVibe Engagement API

- SDK_Example.zip
This is a project file which you should be able to import in Flash Builder

Explanation
-----------()
The 'SVSWC.swc' in the lib folder, is a file which you will add to your library, and give you access to a class called 'SocialvibeProxy(debug:Boolean)'. 
'debug' parameter indicates whether or not you are running this locally, and will give feedback when it can (via trace) instead of actually trying to do calls to the API.
The API will not work properly until it's running in the SocialVibe engagement environment.

Once you instantiate that class, you will have several calls at your disposal for purpose of tracking and various API functionalities.

First be sure to call 'SocialvibeProxy::init()' and listen for the 'READY' event to fire before doing any subsequent calls to the API.

Example
-------
SDK_Example.zip is a really bare bones application that shows the 2 things you MUST do in your engagement/app.

1) File->Import the 'SDK_Example.zip' to your Flash Builder Environment.
2) Notice that 'Project->Properties->Build Path' has SVSWC added to the libraries. This is required. You may have to change the path depending on your environment setup.
3) In the main App class 'SDK_Example.as' you can see how we initialize the 'SocialvibeProxy' and wait for the READY event before building the app, in the constructor function.
4) After the ready event, till the end of engagement, it's up to you to create the engagement as you see fit.

Required API Calls
------------------
- SocialvibeProxy::engage()
Make this call to signal the completion event for the engagement.  The completion event tells our system to grant the user the appropriate user benefit (i.e. Farm Cash on FarmVille) 

- SocialvibeProxy::endEngage()
Make this call after the engage() call at the point the engagement has ended and to show the user a 'congrats & share screen'.


Things to note
--------------
- If you use external SWFs or Files make sure your crossdomain.xml is setup to handle *.socialvibe.com, *.socialvi.be, and *.svnetwork.com.

- Once you are satisfied and ready to do a Release build, make sure to take it out of debug mode. You may want to do something like this to automate it.
