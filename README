Requirments
-----------
Flash Builder 4 or better, must use AS3.

Files Provided
--------------
- SVEngagementAPI.swc
This file wills setup code hinting and load the SocialVibe Engagement API

- EngagementExample.zip
This is a project file which you should be able to import in Flash Builder

Explanation
-----------
The 'SVEngagementAPI.swc' in the lib folder, is a file which you will add to your library, and give you access to a class called 'SocialVibeProxy()'.  This proxy class gives you access to SocialVibe's engagement API.  When your engagement is running outside of SocialVibe's engagement environment, the proxy will run in 'unconnected mode'.  In this mode calls to the API will simply output trace statements since it doesn't have an instance of the API to proxy calls through.

Once you instantiate that class, you will have several calls at your disposal for purpose of saving data, tracking interactions, and various API functionality.

First, be sure to call 'SocialVibeProxy::init()' and listen for the 'SocialVibeProxy.READY' event to fire before doing any subsequent calls to the API.

Example
-------
EngagementExample.zip is a really bare bones application that shows the 2 things you MUST do in your engagement/app.

1) File->Import the 'EngagementExample.zip' to your Flash Builder Environment.
2) Notice that 'Project->Properties->Build Path' has SVEngagementAPI added to the libraries. This is required. You may have to change the path depending on your environment setup.
3) In the main App class 'EngagementExample.as' you can see how we initialize the 'SocialVibeProxy' and wait for the SocialVibeProxy.READY event before building the app, in the constructor function.
4) After the ready event, till the end of engagement, it's up to you to create the engagement as you see fit.

Required API Calls
------------------
- SocialVibeProxy::engage()
Make this call to signal the completion event for the engagement.  The completion event tells our system to grant the user the appropriate user benefit (i.e. Farm Cash on FarmVille) 

- SocialVibeProxy::endEngage()
Make this call after the engage() call at the point the engagement has ended and to show the user a 'congrats & share screen'.


Notes
--------------
- If you use external SWFs or Files make sure your crossdomain.xml is setup to handle *.socialvibe.com, *.socialvi.be, and *.svnetwork.com.
